China-based CIS-Game and Southeast Asian team Arrow Gaming are both facing the possibility that they   ll lose their place in the tournament, which takes place July 18-21 and offers a prize pool of nearly $10 million dollars.<br />\nAccording to posts on the LiquidDota forums, using Chinese social media platform Weibo as a source, CIS-Game was offered no reason for the denial except an apology. Translated by a member of the LiquidDota forums, a spokesperson from CIS-Game reportedly said the team will reapply for the visa.    The 4 Chinese players as well as  manager of CIS have been denied American visas, they're currently preparing for their second try.   <br />\nWhile at least five members of CIS-Game have been denied visas, other veteran representatives from the team have had success. In addition to applying a second time, the team will also appeal to Valve for support.<br />\nMeanwhile, Southeast Asian team Arrow Gaming has also had problems securing visas, prompting them to apply a second time. A spokesperson for the team provided the following statement to OnGamers.<br />\n<br />\n\"With the help from the Minister our chances to receive the visa is higher. Me and Johnny received our visas. However, the other 4 were not so lucky. Valve will also provide us with a stronger letter of invitation to the embassy. So yes, we are hopeful about the second interview. We haven't talked about what will happen if our applications were denied a second time. Valve pretty much guaranteed to help us the best they can to bring our team to Seattle.\"<br />\n<br />\neSports competitors have had a hard time being recognised by the US government.

Surprisingly, it wasn   t the sort of malicious plan you might expect, but a kind of cease-fire alliance meant to bring equal victory to everyone on Steam. As intended, Team Pink won Sunday. Blue won Monday. Purple will win next, if things go smoothly. On Wednesday, a Red victory is scheduled, then Green.<br />\n<br />\nIs a small collective actually having this big of an influence on a Steam-wide, public competition? Valve has already amended the contest to encourage more competition. I took a look at the evidence and spoke to a few of the people caught up in the dark business of virtual trading card market-manipulation.<br />\nHow Valve makes money from the metagame<br />\nFirst, a run-down of how the Steam Summer Adventure works if you   ve been blissfully unaware over the past week, buying and playing discounted PC games rather than being concerned with your gamified game client. Most of Steam   s seasonal sales have included a unique trading card set. Craft a full set of these seasonal cards, and you get something like a unique wallpaper or Steam chat emoticon or in-game reward for a few participating games. The 2014 Steam Summer Sale has its own special set of cards you can badge-ify, but with a twist: participating Steam users are randomly assigned to one of five teams during the sale: Red, Pink, Purple, Blue, or Green. Crafting a badge earns points for your team, and 30 members of the winning team get three free Steam games off their wishlists. Oh, and a few extra cards that they can use to keep crafting.<br />\n<br />\nIn review: buying games earns virtual cards which can be crafted into virtual badges which increase the rate at which you earn booster packs which contain cards which you can use to upgrade your badges. It   s a circular system designed to keep you inside the Steam client, either nickel and diming you to complete your incomplete set of cards or by selling the cards you   ve been given to encourage you to spend that money on a game.<br />\n<br />\nA competition to see who can craft the most badges, of course, makes money directly for Valve and developers by creating more activity on the Steam Market. Valve takes a 5% cut of all transactions, and the developer of the corresponding game takes 10% (a minimum of $0.01 in both cases).<br />\n<br />\nIf I sold one of my Steam Summer Adventure cards for its current value, $0.25, Valve would take three pennies and I   d get $0.22. The Steam Market tells me that 91,650 copies of that card have been sold in the past 24 hours, meaning Valve   s profit of a single Summer Adventure card in a single day could be about $2,800. There are 10 of these cards, and another 10    foil    variants, which run about $2 each.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe community   s plan<br />\nBottom line: we celebrate Steam   s price cuts, but in the middle of the Summer Sale Valve has integrated a system that stimulates the Steam economy and nets them thousands of dollars a day from virtual, non-existent goods. Many cards and booster packs have risen in price throughout the sale; Dota 2 booster packs, for example, went from trading consistently at about $0.25 for the past month to hovering near $0.40 over the past six days.<br />\n<br />\nThe more trading volume and competition, the more the house wins. But a segment of the Steam community is wise to this. They know that a 12-day period when a five-dollar bill can get you our favorite PC game of all time isn   t the best time to be engaged in what   s essentially a spending war. So to discourage, or at least mitigate, frivolous trading card spending, some Redditors and Steam forum members have organized a coalition to take competition out of the equation. They   ve called themselves    Team White,    and they   ve proposed that each Steam team should win twice, on designated days, through June 28.<br />\n<br />\nI spoke to one of the initial organizers behind the plan, Reddit user DayZ_slayer.    It's not really a fun competition when the only real way to win is to spend a lot of cash,    the European 20-year-old told me.    If they did some kind of event that involved playing games it would be a lot more fun to compete, but they didn't, so I figured we all may as well work as a group and give everyone a fair chance at winning some games.   <br />\n<br />\nThis seemed to arise naturally, according to DayZ_slayer: many of the teams who had organized individually were planning to compete harder on specific days, he told me, so suggesting that the colored teams take turns simply formalized that process.    I checked the Steam groups/subreddits for the teams and saw which days they were planning on winning, the first five days or so didn't really clash. I made the list showing who should craft on what day and then posted it on all of the team's subreddits under the name Operation EWT. A little later I made the thread on /r/gaming and some other guy posted it to /r/steam.   <br />\n<br />\nI also spoke to Phil Lendon, a 16-year-old living in England who   s bought into the concept of Team White.    I first noticed the schedule on Reddit on /r/SteamTeamRed which then spread to /r/Steam and I thought it was a really good idea because here on Team Red we're all about teamwork and communication.    When I asked Lendon how much he   s spent toward the contest, he told me that he   s    traded hundreds of pounds    to support Red on Wednesday.    Too much that it's unhealthy,    he says.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nValve's response<br />\nUp until today, the plan had gone smoothly. Each team won on its designated day. But today the plan is showing signs of falling apart. Valve, apparently unhappy with the lack of competition between teams, changed the contest to award second- and third-place prizes to the runners-up each day. Purple may still come away with first place, but at the outset of today it   s already a tight race between the colors.    The game has changed,    a post on the Purple team subreddit reads.    We need to let purple win but go for second,    a member of team Red comments. \"What the heck guys? It's purple's day!\" a Pink thread exclaims. Lendon, the Red team member I spoke to, wrote back to me this morning after he noticed Valve's change to the competition. \"It's turned into a free-for-all, once I had heard of the news I knew it was going to go to hell. However, I believe, as many other Redditors do too, that the new rules for the competition were to prevent the rigging of the competition, as we saw yesterday when Pink one with over a million points above everyone else, Valve had to take action. However, I personally don't believe the changes to the rules are even worth it, as people's chances are even more reduces to win, as-if it wasn't hard enough already to get a winning three games, it'll be even harder for the 2nd place and 3rd place and not even worth the effort.\"<br />\n<br />\nIt   s unclear whether this change will encourage competition enough to disrupt Reddit   s plan. On the surface, it seemed wild to me that a small percentage of people could be driving the massive point swings we saw in the initial four days. After all, there   s only a few hundred people each in these colored Steam groups, and just 140,000 on the Steam subreddit, most of whom probably aren   t aggressively participating.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBut the Steam Market tells us that just a small number of tokens that steal 1,000 points from another team   the most valuable item for influencing the Adventure competition   are trading hands. In the past 24 hours, just 88 have been bought off the Steam Market at between $8 and $5 each, and about the same amount of 500-point tokens were sold in that period. Even if a single team were buying those tokens, it isn   t that much of a swing relative to the 1.2 million that the Blue team earned yesterday.<br />\n<br />\nMore likely, the organized non-competition pact by Reddit and the color-specific Steam communities created single, dominant leader, which not only discouraged the other    big spenders    who are engaged in this competition but probably discouraged some amount of casual crafters from chipping in too.<br />\n<br />\nWith the adjustment made by Valve, today will be an interesting test of the internet   s ability to dictate the outcome. Purple, who   s meant to win today, has a modest lead as I   m publishing this, but we   ll have to see if the Steam Trading Card Illuminati   s grand plan survives through the week.

Counter-Strike is about shooting numberbullets into the other guys' numberfaces until all of their numberbrains fall out. Football (see also: soccer) is about how many goals you score and how many shirts you sell and how much it costs to ship vast premanufactured chunks of stadium up the Amazon.<br />\n<br />\nIt's all numbers, and Dota 2 has no greater or fewer than any other game. But it does host some truly, spectacularly, galvanizingly pointless numbers. Digits that communicate nothing and convey no worth. They exist outside of any formula or algorithm, and to treat them as if they mean anything is to slip into the kind of superstition usually reserved for numerologists. We're dealing with the unknowable, here, with un-knowledge: you might want to sit down. Some people can't handle it.<br />\n<br />\nLet's not be those people.<br />\n<br />\nUSELESS NUMBER #1: The level of your Dota 2 Steam badge.<br />\n<br />\nI have a level five Steam badge for Dota 2. I have no earthly idea why this is something that I acquired on purpose. At some point last year   shortly after TI3, according to my Steam profile   I decided that it was important that I collect five full sets of Dota 2 trading cards. I believe I received a discount on capable puzzle platformer Toki Tori for doing so, but that's not why I did it.<br />\n<br />\nIf the decision involved any thought at all, it went something like this: I like to play Dota 2, and I like to perform tasks related to Dota 2. It followed that I'd enjoy scanning the Steam market in order to purchase pictures of characters for pennies and then binding these pictures to my profile so that somebody might look at my profile and think \"this person considers Dota 2 to be an entertaining way to spend time\". As if they couldn't pick that up from the many other numbers at the top of my Recent Game Activity: 42.3 hours past 2 weeks. 1,477 hrs on record.<br />\n<br />\nWhatever the reason, I have a level five Steam badge for Dota 2. Many of my friends have them as well. All I can take from this is that Valve are very good at providing people with opportunities to lose money in ways that seem like total nonsense when considered with the front part of your brain. Impish little money-siphons that vanish when you look right at them, like fairies at the bottom of the garden. Fairies that turn out to be real and force you to remortgage your house every time there's a Steam Sale.<br />\n<br />\nUSELESS NUMBER #2:  The number of your friends who play Dota 2.<br />\n<br />\nSo here's a fun observation: I have 136 friends who play Dota 2 according to Steam. I have 137 friends who play Team Fortress 2. All these numbers indicate is that a fairly substantial chunk of Steam's user base will at some point boot up either of Valve's free to play games. In Dota's case, the number is most useful for giving you some sense of how many people start playing the game and immediately run the other way   like Han Solo in A New Hope if he'd burst into a room full of wizards and internet dickheads instead of Stormtroopers.<br />\n<br />\nI'm fascinated by the difference between the two values, though. Who were you, one person who never loaded Dota 2? What was it that put you off? Was it the dickheads? I bet it was the dickheads.<br />\n<br />\nUSELESS NUMBER #3:  The current count on any of your 'Wards Placed' gems.<br />\n<br />\nA personal milestone: my 'Enemies Culled' gem hit triple figures today. I've only had it for a few months, but that gem means something to me. I love Axe very much, and believe strongly that Culling Blade is the best ability in the game. One hundred dunks is significant: each dunk a happy memory, and each a reminder of the many thousand more dunks that I've been unjustly denied by kill-hungry allies. I die a little bit inside every time some quote-unquote \"core\" hero decides that their need to buy game-winning items supersedes my need to welcome our enemies to the jam. Those hundred dunks are the few, the brave, the just. Reaching this milestone is a sign that there is still some good left in the world.<br />\n<br />\nI don't feel nearly as strongly about the three hundred or so wards I've placed as Rubick and Crystal Maiden, and I'm not sure anybody else does either. In fact, I think the majority of the strangers I've played with would argue that those wards were never placed at all. My 'Wards Placed' gems are documentary proof of something that the majority of people won't believe anyway: that buying all of the support items didn't actually win us any games, and ultimately has nothing to do with our unfashionable MMR ratings. Better not to track wards placed at all, really.<br />\n<br />\nUSELESS NUMBER #4:  Commendations.<br />\n<br />\nI'd like a special report function for people who say \"commend me\" at the end of games. Nothing serious. I don't want Valve to actually act on it, or even pay attention to it. But I want to be able to press a button that says \"this person is a dingdong\" and have that information recorded somewhere. It would make me feel substantially better about Dota in general if I could quietly add people to the dingdong list, you know? For posterity.<br />\n<br />\nTo the point, though: if you've just won the game, you don't need another prize. Asking for a commendation at the end of a match is like turning to your parents at the end of your seventh birthday party and asking if there are any more presents. Of course there aren't. They've given you everything they can give. Now stop being a brat, get out of the fountain, and let us all get along with our days.<br />\n<br />\nIn reality, though, all those dingdongs are doing is reflecting something of the meaninglessness of the commendation system. They don't do anything, or particularly signify anything, so why not give them freely? It's a little number hidden at the bottom of your profile. You have to scroll down to see it, for god's sake. What difference does it make?<br />\n<br />\nCommending somebody in Dota 2 is like leaving a Yelp review for your favourite restaurant in the aftermath of global nuclear war. I mean, the sentiment is nice. It's great that you can, you know, register your approval. But it's too late, friend. It's too late for both of us.<br />\n<br />\nUSELESS NUMBER #5:  The prize pool for every tournament other than The International if you have ever won The International.<br />\n<br />\nHere's what occurred to me while watching Alliance return to form during the DreamLeague finals last week: if I won The International, I wouldn't try for the rest of the year. My invitation to the next tournament would be guaranteed. I'd have enough money to live off the proceeds without winning any other titles. I'd spend that time expanding my hero pool, having a good time, and   pointedly   not giving anything away about the strategies or drafts that might help me top up my earnings at the end of the year.<br />\n<br />\nThe International prize pool is going to top ten million dollars. Is there a universe where this doesn't profoundly change the attitude of top teams towards the other tournaments? I don't think there is.<br />\n<br />\nUSELESS NUMBER #6:  Your MMR.<br />\n<br />\nI know, right?<br />\n<br />\nYour MMR is probably the most important pointless number in Dota 2. It's the one you see the most of, anyway. If not your personal digits than their implications: your skill level rendered with a specificity which is specifically attractive to a certain kind of player. Since Valve decided to make player ratings public these numbers have taken on totemic significance. It's not enough to have a high MMR: you have to be seen to be utterly dismissive of whatever your number means. \"I'm just 5K trash\" says everybody. \"Don't mind me.\" A kind of Catholic guilt affected to disguise ego and insecurity. Strife attributed to a four-digit value that nobody is particularly sure how to parse anyway.<br />\n<br />\nIntroducing a visible MMR was as close to a balls-to-the-wall mistake as Valve have ever made. Its influence has been almost entirely negative. It armed the community against itself, chucking pointy sticks into a mob already prone to aggressive brinkmanship. I'm still not sure who benefits.<br />\n<br />\nYet there it is. It's your score, your rating, your place, and you're expected to know it. I say ditch the whole thing. Play like you want to get better and don't worry about whether your MMR goes up or down. Play the same way over and over if that's how you want to spend your time, not because you think it'll buy you access to some higher level of play. You can find that anywhere. Let your MMR become the reason you play Dota and you give up on all that discovery, friendship, meaning that the game turns up when it's firing on all cylinders. Fight the urge to hinge the whole thing on a number. It's poison, friend. Then again I'm 3K trash and I would say that.<br />\n<br />\nClick here to read more Three Lane Highway.                ",

He's seen every part of the business, from amateur bedroom casting to addressing thousands of people on stage. Next week, he'll be hosting his first Dota 2 tournament   ESL One Frankfurt. Earlier in the week I spoke to Paul about his expectations for the tournament, how he goes about preparing for an event this big, and how the business of presenting e-sports has changed over the years.<br />\n<br />\nIn the run up to presenting something like ESL One, what do you do?<br />\n<br />\nAs a host, as I am at ESL One, it starts weeks before, sometimes months before. ESL One for me started back in March. The reason is because I've never done Dota 2 before. It starts with playing the game, understanding the mechanics, the heroes. Generally getting a good feel for the game. I guess I've probably put in about eighty hours of gameplay since March, which is enough to give me a reasonable base of understanding. Alongside that is drenching myself in the community. Understanding the funny stuff, understanding the memes that they use.<br />\n<br />\nEvery community is very different. Starcraft is quite intellectual, while the Dota community is much more fun. You really need to be in tune with that. With Dota, it's really important to me that I'm connected to the crowd and the people back at home and I understand what they want from the show. I've found that to be part of a winning formula for hosting well at shows. ESL One's no different.<br />\n<br />\nWhat stories are you looking forward to see play out at ESL One, given that this is the last big tournament before TI4?<br />\n<br />\nWell we've got all three previous International winners and that's a storyline in its own right. iG are looking pretty strong right now but Na'Vi and Alliance   they're the big names but they've not been playing much and when they have been playing they've not been playing that well. For me it's intruiging whether the five that have not got an International title to their name, can they step up a few weeks before TI4 and give these guys something to think about? What does that do to them, going into TI? If Alliance win this at a canter, what signal does that send to everyone else? If they don't win it, and they crash out in the quarters, what signal does that send to them about how much harder they're going to have to work?<br />\n<br />\nIf Dendi reaches the semi-final   this a smaller, personal story   he'll become the highest-earning player in the world. He's currently third, but he's only a few thousand short. He'll become the most successful e-sports player of all time, two weeks before TI4 which will then change all that. It's ironic, really.<br />\n<br />\nProviding that he gets to second place in the International again, he'll probably be fine.<br />\n<br />\nHe might well be the first guy to go over a million, as well. We look for stories like that   we've got a ton of them, but those are the key ones for me. The big ones.<br />\n<br />\nE-sports presenting requires increasingly more professionalism and craft, but people still come into it through the hobby   from their bedrooms. Do you think that will change?<br />\n<br />\nI think so. If you look at the early days of football on TV and radio, they struggled   they'd often grab someone who had a good voice or who just loved the game. Murray Walker for instance started in motorbike racing and went to Brands Hatch every weekend to do some commentary from the track. I see some parallels in e-sports. In the last 10-12 years we've got some people who have come from where I was, bedroom shoutcasting, but now we've also got Twitch which more like bedroom TV. That helps them an awful lot, but the entry level is still very low. Not every tournament has the means to pay people and because of that you end up with a potentially lower level of professionalism.<br />\n<br />\nA lot of the guys that come in now get thrown in at the deep end. I was very lucky   I had a few years of doing bedroom shoutcasting and a few years of doing video to, er, not many people. These guys get thrown in on a giant tournament and it's their first time and they go out to 150,000 people and mistakes are very big in that environment. I think it's nice that the entry level is low but it does mean that we're still growing.<br />\n<br />\nIf you look at sports on TV right now there are a lot more presenters that have come from professional TV backgrounds. We're on that road, and I suppose my fear as an e-sports person is that we either step up or make way for the pros. We either need to help everyone get up to a good level or eventually when events have enough money they're just going to replace us with professional talent. I don't mind that so much   you get the professionalism   but I'd much rather have the people that are passionate about their game.<br />\n<br />\nWhat's your feeling about the vast amount of money in Dota 2 this year? What are the ramifications not just for Dota, but for e-sports in general?<br />\n<br />\nI think we have to wait another year before we figure out what it does to the landscape, but overall its a good thing. It's a sea change in how tournaments can fund themselves, because the majority of the money has come from us. It'd be interesting to see how that falls.<br />\n<br />\nIf somebody is trying to break into casting   doing the squirrel-league stuff   is there anything that people regularly get wrong that they could fix to move up a bracket?<br />\n<br />\nThis will sound really harsh, but the biggest problem is that most people see the low entry level and think \"yeah, I could do that\". In their head, it's like singing in the shower. I like singing in the shower and in my head I sound quite good   but if I was to sing publicly people would be crying and asking me to leave the area. Shoutcasting is like that. In your head, you think \"I would have said this, or what was this guy talking about, he's talking rubbish.\" After a while you feel compelled to try it   you're probably quite good at it!<br />\n<br />\nThe problem is that 90% of the people who go onto Twitch or start up an audio channel have the passion   they absolutely have the passion   and love their game, but don't have the voice or personality to be able to project properly and entertain someone. What they do is maybe too in-depth.<br />\n<br />\nAs a play-by-play commentator, your number one job is to grab someone by the balls, hurl them in and make them love what they're watching. That would be my number one thing. Sometimes, people unfortunately aren't born with the right voice or the right personality to be able to do that. They're very good at knowledge, they're very passionate, but they're unable to project that via a microphone. It's the harshest feedback I can give someone, but I'm always very blunt and honest with people.<br />\n<br />\nI think you can work on other aspects   you can be phenomenally good at nine or ten of the other skills that you need that may make up for it, but it's very rare.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nE-sports' growth is extraordinary   but is that the pattern for the future? Is there a ceiling for how big it can get?<br />\n<br />\nI can talk about what I've seen over the last couple of years. It's always been rises and falls. We went through the years of CPL in the early 2000s and they looked like noone could touch them. Then it fell apart, they lost a lot of contracts, their money didn't come in and they didn't pay people. Suddenly ESWC and WCG are the big things, and then they change their models and go more mobile and they fall off in e-sports terms. Then CGS comes along with $50m and it's all on live TV all over the world   Eurosport and Sky Sports   and we think okay, maybe we've arrived.<br />\n<br />\nThen that falls apart and we're picking up the pieces again. For me it's always been peaks and troughs until the last three years. 2012, 2013 and 2014 have been always upward in almost every area. But specifically, more than anything else, the biggest change for me over the last fifteen years is the advent of Twitch. If we hadn't got Twitch when we did I'm absolutely certain that we would not be where we are today with the size and scope of e-sports.<br />\n<br />\nTo answer your question, it can get bigger   but I'm not sure that it can sustain quite the sharp rise that it's had in the last eighteen months. But we're getting the kind of viewership that NHL would be proud of in North America. We're way exceeding things like BMX biking at its peak. That's kind of how I look at e-sports as we've got bigger   how do we compare to other niche sports?<br />\n<br />\nIt also comes back to what we've been talking about for the last couple of years, which is the change in how we consume media. Most people watching Twitch don't even own a television, and if they do they link it up to the internet and watch Twitch on it. We just don't watch TV in the traditional way any more.<br />\n<br />\nWe always talk about the future of e-sports as a transition into other form of media   \"maybe we'll see this on the TV some day!\" Do we still want that?<br />\n<br />\nNo! CGS was that moment, it was 2007, we were doing live shows from the Playboy mansion. SXSW. We we're on Eurosport, ESPN, Sky Sports. \"Hurrah, we've arrived!\" But actually, we missed the point. We didn't need mainstream. The mainstream is now coming to us   they're looking at what Twitch is doing, what ESL have done. They're studying us, now. They're starting to understand that we're the forerunners. Gamers were the first ones to pick up social media. The first ones to do livestreaming. The first ones to do shoutcasting. The first ones to do internet radio. We're always the first to adopt new technology and do well with it. I guess we're starting to see our reward, now.<br />\n<br />\nIn that case, do we need to stop seeing television success as more 'legitimate' than online success?<br />\n<br />\nIn my mind, seeing e-sports clips on Sky Sports is still amazing. It would definitely add legitimacy to what we're doing. Do we need it to succeed, though? No. We don't. Five or six years ago we did, and that's what's changed.<br />\n<br />\nDo you have any thoughts on why MOBAs particularly have picked up this head of steam? Pun not intended.<br />\n<br />\nI think it's a coincidence that it's MOBAs in particular that have risen to the top. It's more the model that they're using   the free to play model. They were the first games to use it. There wasn't a FPS until Team Fortress 2, which wasn't a massive e-sports game in the first place. CS:GO will hopefully go free to play   I wonder how big that could get if it did. I wonder if we'd be seeing multi-million dollar prize pools for that game and I think we would. We've not had a free to play RTS game either, really.<br />\n<br />\nBut team games in particular have always gripped e-sports fans more. The success of Counter-Strike is proof of that. There's room for one-on-one games too, not just in RTS but in FPS. We've been waiting a long time for that   Quake Live tried but it didn't really work. Epic have just announced that they're going to bring Unreal Tournament back and that's going to be free-to-play. I'm interested to see what they'll do over the next twelve months.<br />\n<br />\nBut it's still the payment model more than the game that leads to this kind of success, which doesn't take away from the fact that MOBAs are terrifically fun to play!<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your time.<br />\n<br />\nESL One Frankfurt will run from Saturday the 28th of June to Sunday the 29th at the Commerzbank Arena. If you'd like to attend in person, tickets are available online.                ",

I was reading this article about faster-than-light travel in the Washington Post, an article that includes probably the most exciting picture of a spaceship on the internet at the moment. The article links back to a previous interview between io9 and leading NASA engineer Harold White in which he describes the search for his \"Chicago Pile moment\".<br />\n<br />\n\"Chicago Pile moment\" is his own coinage, and refers to the development of the first nuclear reactor in Chicago in 1942. It generated very little power, looked like a stack of bricks, and took up most of a large room   but it was proof that nuclear power was a possibility in practical terms. After the Chicago Pile, building a viable reactor was a matter of improving on proven principles. It's the difference between trying to tame the yeti in your garden and trying to prove that the yeti exists at all.<br />\n<br />\nThat's a terrible analogy, which is why I'm glad that I can say \"Chicago Pile moment\" instead. I like the phrase so much that I'm now going to hang a column about internet wizards off it, because, you know, this is the point that I'm at in my life.<br />\n<br />\nI lost a game of Dota 2 last night. This happens quite a lot. Just over fifty percent of the time, if I'm honest. Last night's loss was special, though   exciting. If it's possible for a loss to be energising, that's what this was.<br />\n<br />\nThe match was between the team I'm in, Hot Dukes   who I've written about before, briefly   and Dwayne The John Rockson, one of the best teams in the UK circuit. It was our first game in anything resembling a proper competition. The match was a stomp; the XP and gold graphs both look like a ski slope in our opponent's favour. I'd entered us into the ESL Dota 2 Challenge to get a sense of where we fit in the food chain, and we discovered that we were minnows at the bottom of a small pond. But that wasn't what I was afraid of.<br />\n<br />\nMy biggest fear was that we'd lose in a way that disproved the possibility of future success. That we'd be beaten by strategies and methodologies that we had no hope of replicating ourselves, that we'd be up against people playing a different game than we were. That our hours of practice would be shown to be totally without purpose. That's how it went the first time I entered a tournament: not just outclassed but discredited, the road ahead veering up sharply and becoming a wall. The team I entered with didn't last long after that because we couldn't wrap our heads around just how bad we were; the number of things we didn't know exceeded the bounds of computable mathematics.<br />\n<br />\nAfter last night's match my new team watched the replay, howling with embarrassment at some of our incredible blunders. Here are some hot tips that I can share with you as a newly-minted competitive gamer: don't teleport two people onto a besieged tier one tower for no particular reason. Don't wander into the side shop assuming that it'll be fine. Don't put an Ion Shell on the creep that the enemy tower is about to target. Don't dive two towers against a team that knows what a teleport scroll is. If you have to ask whether Chronosphere is off cooldown, it's probably too late. And so on.<br />\n<br />\nWe're going to have to try hard to make good on all of this new information. We're going to have to be tryhards, and I'm keenly aware of how much all of this   forming a team, giving the team a name that we like, thinking about the team, practicing as a team, having hopes and dreams at all   is likely to attract that word. I'm not totally convinced that I care.<br />\n<br />\nCompetitive Dota, even at this low level, reminds me of the comedy scene. I made the comparison between Dota and improv only a few weeks after I started playing, and that connection has deepened since. I was an improviser for a couple of years, and my group followed the American method   the Chicago style, as it happens   and that meant lots of trust exercises and lessons in mutual respect and selflessness and putting the show before yourself and so on.<br />\n<br />\nStand-up was different: nastier, much of the time, with a lot more ego floating around, particularly among men. A culture of being pointedly dismissive because you were afraid of being pointedly dismissed. Competitive to the extreme. Young competitive men have a habit of cloaking everything they do in irony, because it's uncool to try and uncool to trust and deeply uncool to give a shit.<br />\n<br />\nThe reason that this is not something to clasp your hands and look concerned about is that it gets results. It produces sharp, funny, uncompromising comedians just as it creates assertive, entertaining Dota pros. But it is not the only way to get results, which is something that the comedy scene has understood for a while but that pro gaming, with its different balance of age, gender and attitude, has been slower to catch up on   at least in the west. With the Dukes I wanted to build a Dota team with the attitude of an improv group, so I pulled together people with a very particular attitude: cooperative, relaxed, moderate. I wanted to prove to myself that it was possible to build a competitive apparatus without the strife and ego and snark that'd put me off e-sports in the past.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the first things we did as a team was establish a structure for giving and receiving criticism after a loss. We're not allowed to flame each other, even in the heat of the moment. Criticism has to be simple and direct and grounded in practical instructions. We've not got a perfect track record, but we're getting better at it, and most importantly it's this attitude that has allowed us to absorb last night's big loss and walk away smiling with a plan for the future. No arguments, no ego. Well, some ego.<br />\n<br />\nAnd that was our Chicago Pile moment. The theory can be reproduced in reality. We lost soundly but understood why, and have arrived at a point where we were capable of quickly and collectively processing a negative result into something we can work with. There's a long road ahead, but at least the road exists  - and we've already taken a few tiny steps along it. We've proven the existence of success in microscale, a few flickering watts of winning in a hollow chamber full of fail. The yeti is in the garden.<br />\n<br />\nThat is still a shitty metaphor.<br />\n<br />\nClick here to read previous Three Lane Highway columns.                ",

It's one of the last high profile Dota 2 competitions before The International, and the best chance most European fans are going to get to watch some of these teams play before they win eleventy million dollars at TI4, buy private islands, and vanish.<br />\n<br />\nIf you're considering attending then you probably play Dota 2. You know something about the meta, drafting, laning, teamfights, whatever. You're capable of replicating many of the things that you watch professional teams do   albeit imperfectly   on your own time, and doing so constitutes a big part of your hobby. You watch Dota because you play Dota.<br />\n<br />\nThat might seem like an obvious point to make but it is the single most glaring distinction between electronic sport and physical sport, traditional sport, meat sport, whatever you want to call it. Dota 2 spectators are also players because it's easy to be a player, even if it's difficult to play well; the distinction between a professional and the rest of us isn't quite as pronounced as it is in other forms of sport. Spectators learn to look for the innumerable infintessimally small ways in which professional players express their talent over the course of a match: the things they don't do, the space that a small action creates, the late-game impact of an early-game twist of the knife.<br />\n<br />\nIt's for this reason that professional Dota 2 is incredibly hard to watch if you don't play the game. The same is true for StarCraft, to an extent, but StarCraft benefits from the fact that is a contest between armies, a unit of competition that most people will understand. Dota 2 is about ghosts and fish people and bears who really hate each other's rock gardens. You can make comparisons to basketball and chess all you like, but nobody has ever included a sapient ball of beep-booping light on a basketball team and Gary Kasparov never won a match from the back of a prowling jungle panther, much to everybody's great loss.<br />\n<br />\nI don't think that this necessarily needs to be the case. The difficulty of watching professional Dota, I mean, not the thing about Gary Kasparov and a panther. That's not going to happen. But it's not impossible for newcomers to get something out of watching ESL One or The International. They just need to be told where to look, and what to look for. In a game that overwhelms with detail, the easiest way to access the good stuff is to refine and simplify.<br />\n<br />\nWhen heroes fight, look at positioning   not abilties. Teamfights are the single most difficult thing for a new spectator to parse. They're an expression of the game's churning background algorithms. Economics and skills smash into one another and create a new variable that is woven back into the match itself. Eventually, you're going to need to understand all of it   the abilities being used, the items, the heroes, the phase of the game, all of it. At first, though, look at where people are standing.<br />\n<br />\nPay attention to the relative positions of opposing heroes. Who's alone or unprotected? Who is moving aggressively forward? Who is being forced to move, either by threat of danger or a particular spell? Much of Dota 2 is forcing the other guy to make a sub-optimal play, and you can detect inefficiency by figuring out which team is leading and which team is reacting. Strip away the map and the characters and the casters for a bit and see the heroes as pieces on a board. If you're familiar with other team sports or strategy games then thinking of Dota in terms of movement makes it much easier to parse. Don't worry about skillshots or stun-stacking or whatever: think about flanking movements, feints, counter-attacks and the rest will follow. If somebody is bellowing \"BLACK HOOOLE!\", accept that it is exciting and concentrate on the important fact: a whole bunch of characters are now squashed together where they don't want to be.<br />\n<br />\nAt the beginning of the game, watch how teams arrange themselves on the map   and how they change it up after a few minutes. A lot of arcane thinking goes into the laning phase. Support characters will spend this time doing unfathomable things in the jungle to prepare their teams for the midgame. Carries will wave their weapons in little statacco 'no-no-no-yes' motions before smacking creeps so that money falls out. Midlaners will periodically rush off up or down the river to gather up a magic rune (?) that is actually a glowing coloured rock (?) with magic properties including the ability to refill a bottle with water (?)<br />\n<br />\nYou're probably not going to understand any of this on day one, so look at the minimap instead. Treat the early game as one very large, very slow teamfight, and figure out who is moving to get the jump on the other team and who is moving to react. That'll give you a sense of who is leading the game, and their success or failure will almost certainly become the narrative of the match as a whole.<br />\n<br />\nWorry about objectives, not graphs or battles. An objective is anything that a team can claim or destroy to get themselves closer to the enemy ancient. This is normally a tower, and sometimes Roshan. Even in the professional scene you'll sometimes see teams focus on winning fights to the exclusion of the objectives that actually win the game. If it's not obvious who is coming out on top of teamfights, look at who is managing to claim objectives afterwards. You can tell the difference by the way the commentators respond. Teamfights are exciting. People yell. People talk very quickly. Afterwards, though, somebody will say something slowly and clearly about towers lost or space created or Roshan attempts uncontested, and this is the main thing you should be paying attention to at this point.<br />\n<br />\nConcentrate on a caster's tone, not what they're saying. Knowledge is important, and imparting it is a crucial part of a caster's job, but it's not the part that a newcomer is going to find especially useful. Or, to put a finer point on it, game knowledge is best absorbed slowly. If you try to understand everything that gets said you'll be turned off the game. Somebody will say something about someone called \"Lunar Russian, Herman the Dominator\" and you will have no idea that he's talking about a panther-riding moon lady opting for lifesteal over magic immunity. You don't need to. That's fine. Their tone tells you that this might be a risky thing to have happened, whatever it is: Herman the Dominator might be in trouble. That's all you need to know.<br />\n<br />\nLet casters steer the mood of the game and accept that you'll figure out the details slowly. This is more or less the only way to do it. Besides: it's as easy as it gets. The amount of worthy action occurring on screen is directly proportional to the number of people who are currently screaming. Unless you are in the Korean casting booth during The International 2013. In that case, well, disregard everything I just said.<br />\n<br />\nTo read more Three Lane Highway, click here.",

Competition for status is written into our society and culture. It is why we valourise the assertion of individual will and downplay collective success. It's how teenagers figure out who they are. It's how democracy (sort of) functions, how movies get made, how lies pass into general acceptance. It's a process we can't shake, a process that generates politicians and celebrities and bullies and   to the point   some really, really shitty Dota players.<br />\n<br />\nDota 2 is about other people. Its strangest contradiction is that it demands a huge amount of collaboration and selflessness but that the loudest praise will always be reserved for individual people and individual plays. This contradiction is how the same crowd that went wild for fountain-hooking at last year's International can then decry the tournament's eventual champions as rats for making a series of solid if unflashy strategic decisions. We're trained to praise the exceptional over the capable, to chase exceptional victories instead of, you know, victories. This is one of those lazy default positions that demands real thought to conquer. It's essential to get over yourself in order to be any good at Dota, but doing so means shaking yourself out of the notion that a competitive game is there to give you what you want. It means losing the idea that you are the hero.<br />\n<br />\nWhen a game becomes a sport, it sheds many of the ideas that come with being a commercial entertainment product. In sport, you don't assume that everybody who takes part has a right to win or even a right to have everything their way. These assumptions are common in gaming, however, legacies of the notion that the customer knows best; that the player is the person in charge. Yet in Dota, as in sport, there will always be people who try to buy in to the kind of legitimacy that only practice can really earn; who believe that they can warp sport into a game that they control. The guy who buys lots of Pudge cosmetics and locks him at the start of every game is the same guy who shows up to a tennis court with expensive gear and no idea what he's doing.<br />\n<br />\nPudge is the most popular hero in the game by an order of magnitude because he's Dendi's hero, even though Dendi rarely plays him competitively; because he represents the lone skillful player rather than the boring collective. Yet locking Pudge is also shorthand for a naive and solipsistic view of the game for exactly this reason   it indicates that somebody is incapable of putting the game at hand ahead of the fantasies that they'd like to entertain about themselves.<br />\n<br />\nThis is where the nature of videogames   and, in particular, Dota's origins as an RPG-RTS hybrid   complicate things even further. I used to try to embody myself in every competitive game I played. I had a couple of boring and unoriginal ideas about who I wanted to be   the assassin, the lone wolf, the rogue agent   and I bullishly stuck to them regardless of my success level or the needs of the people around me. I slipped into scrubland, to borrow David Sirlin's use of the term. I wanted to win on my own terms, not somebody else's.<br />\n<br />\nTo an extent, this is reasonable. The promise of an RPG is experiencing adventure and triumph as an idealised version of yourself; the appeal of an RTS is in seeing your strategic mind actualised in the movement of pieces on a board or map. I can look at Dota 2's roster of heroes and see myself in some of them but not others. I might want to be Storm Spirit, and decide that Storm Spirit is who I'm going to play, but then I'm going to learn that I'm really Dark Seer. I'm really Phoenix. I'm really Centaur Warrunner. I'm really Mirana. I'm really whoever the hell my team needs me to be.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying as part of an organised team has taught me a lot over the last couple of weeks, but the biggest thing I've learned is that it's wins that matter, not people or plays. Dota 2 is a game about looking at five players and five heroes and figuring out how to arrange them so that the other guy's magical rock garden blows up. That's all there it is to it   but resolving that formula requires selflessness and collaboration. It requires individuals to give up their individuality in service to a greater goal, and that is why it is such an uphill struggle when you're queuing for matches by yourself. Individualism is the norm; the dream that this time   this time!   I'm going to be the hero is the game's most crooked draw.<br />\n<br />\nIf you feel like you can only play a particular kind of Dota, force yourself into the unfamiliar. Play Single Draft, or Least Played, or something. If you only want to play a particular kind of Dota, then understand that you're waiving your right to complain when games don't go your way. Dota, like society or any other cooperative enterprise, does not function when individuals are only looking out for themselves. I appreciate that I am probably going to piss off a bunch of libertarians by framing the issue in that way, but I'm okay with that.<br />\n<br />\nThe really cool thing about videogames is that they can be used as a way of practicing shifts in behaviour or thinking that can be mirrored in other contexts. The game is victim to all sorts of social and cultural pressures that bring about undesirable traits in its players, but it also exists in dialogue with those pressures   it is possible, by learning to put other people before yourself in a videogame, to get some sense of what that change might look like in the rest of your life.<br />\n<br />\nTo read more Three Lane Highway, click here.",

He's crying because a couple of years ago he was all like \"we should sell an internet magic computer book for our competitive online game\" and his bosses were all like \"lol no\". He's crying because everyday he has to fill out reports with words like \"outreach\" and \"conversion\" on them. He's crying because the Dota community has, at the time of writing, spent $18,867,328 on internet magic computer books.<br />\n<br />\nThe Dota 2 community has purchased almost 1.9 million of these books in just shy of two weeks. Every day, 150,000 people   equivalent to the entire population of the Dota subreddit   think \"yes, it's time for another magical computer book, thank you.\" I am not in a position to question the value of the Compendium. It's really well made! And I own two and a half of them.<br />\n<br />\nBut these are still the kind of numbers that make you think. It's hard to explain exactly why 2014's Compendium has been so much more popular than last year's. It's a better product, certainly. You get more items for buying it, the stretch goals have more of an immediate impact on the game itself, and leveling it up is compulsive and carries a tangible   if ephemeral   benefit. It could just be that a lot of people are willing to drop the price of an indie game on a battle booster and the promise of a special hat.<br />\n<br />\nIt could also be that the community really does want The International to be a big deal   that all that investment really is targeted at inflating the prize pool to the point where this year's winners will become some of the richest people in e-sports. There's credibility in that. This is after all a game about ego, competition, and victory through sheer weight of numbers: it is not out of the question for the Dota community to sit back and decide to farm out their lategame advantage.<br />\n<br />\nThen there's the outlying chance that we've all been hypnotised. That Valve's experimental psychoeconomics has exploded out across the internet in a great flash of purple light, wallets bursting in its wake.<br />\n<br />\nI think there's probably a little bit of truth in all of these. They all contribute to the notion that The International is an event   and that the Compendium, while not a ticket, is nonetheless a way of confirming your participation in that event. People want to belong, and they want to be seen to belong. Valve's genius is evident in the moments when other people get to see just how much everybody else has participated   in the countdown at the start of a match where you find out how big everybody's magical internet book is. The community's genius, on the other hand, has been to collectively amplify the importance of the Compendium itself. I didn't even think before buying the Compendium. I just saw it and bought it, because I'm a part of this community and, well, that's what you do.<br />\n<br />\nWithout the community, for example, the Arcana item vote would be a transparent means of gathering marketing information   a little like those internet quizzes that tie into your Facebook profile and ask you pointed questions about your spending patterns. The community makes this whole process less cynical, turns the vote into something fun where people can argue about whether or not Io should get a face painted on him. The Compendium becomes, thanks to the discussion it creates, part of the life and character of the game.<br />\n<br />\nThen you extrapolate this process across the game's expanding audience, across the ambassadorial role of e-sports and the popularity driven by last year's International and, yeah   many internet magic computer books get sold.<br />\n<br />\nThe funny thing about success like this is that it makes it very difficult to figure out what the future of the game is going to look like. At the moment, it feels like the good things about the Dota community expand fractally across the scene at every level   from the jokes shared by friends who regularly play together to forum communities, reddit, and outwards. Accross nationalities and languages. I wonder about how long that will be the case   whether or not we'll reach a point where Dota is so big that this sense of a singular collective effort   expressed through the Compendium drive   won't be quite so pronounced. That'd be a shame, I guess, but it'd also signify actual global saturation.<br />\n<br />\nIt'd be hard to be too angry about not being special any more when Dota games are being shown on television, or projected onto the moon, or something.<br />\n<br />\nThis year's International is going to be telling either way. Last year, Valve's Erik Johnson told me in an interview that they were probably going to stick with Benaroya Hall for 2014   that the focus would be expanding the spectator experience online, rather than allowing more people to attend in person. For whatever reason, that's not the decision that was made. This year's tournament is going to take place in a much bigger space, with much more people in the audience   and a worse view, inevitably, for some. The money will mean more to the victors and falling short of that money, if Valve stick to the old distribution model, will have an even greater effect on the scene in the year that follows. It's easy to see that $18m investment as one part of a fractal expansion of competitive Dota at every level.<br />\n<br />\nIs this the pattern for the future, I wonder? Endless growth without fractures forming, without oversaturation or compromise? I ask now, because that has never happened before.<br />\n<br />\nIf you'd like to read more Three Lane Highway, click here.",

Yesterday, the Dota 2 community completed their quest to give Valve all of the money. The prize pool for the upcoming International tournament stood at $6 million, meaning over $4.4 million had been raised from sales of the Compendium sticker-book and its corresponding point system. Now, Valve have unveiled more stretch goals, with potential rewards reaching to the   10 million mark.<br />\n<br />\nHere's what the new stretch goals will unlock:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n$6,800,000: Earn 25 compendium points every day by winning a game with the Hero we choose for you.<br />\n$7,200,000: Vote for the Hero you'd like to receive a new, alternate voice &amp; dialogue pack.<br />\n$7,600,000: Select one of your Least Played heroes and we'll provide a GPM/XPM analysis tool during the game to help you compare your performances with previous games<br />\n$8,000,000: Vote for the Hero you'd like to receive a reworked model.<br />\n$8,400,000: You'll receive an item that customizes your Multi-Kill Banner.<br />\n$8,800,000: Live Broadcasting of the after party with special guest Darude.<br />\n$9,200,000: Unlocks new models for your creeps after you've killed the enemy barracks. (Available to all players, not just Compendium Owners)<br />\n$9,600,000: A new quest system will be added to track your progress, and earn you rewards as you win. (Available to all players)<br />\n$10,000,000: Unlocks the ability for you to perform a voice taunt with your Hero in the early stages of the game.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWill the community spring to an extra $4 million? Based on the trends of these graphs, it's certainly a possibility. But then, only 25% of each Compendium and point sale goes towards the prize pool total. If the $10 million marker is reached, it will mean that approximately $33.6 million will have been spent on International items.",

If a copy of Dota 2's Compendium costs $10/  6 (which it does), and $2.50 of that goes to the International 2014's prize pool (which it does), and that prize pool   which launched at a base level of $1.6 million   currently stands at over $6 million (which it does), then how much deeper is Gabe Newell's swimming pool tribute to Scrooge McDuck? The answer is lots.* Valve aren't the only winner of this equation, though. The participants of the Dota 2 tournament have a much bigger prize to compete for, and the Dota 2 community have now secured the entirety of the Compendium's stretch goals.<br />\n<br />\nIt's not just the amount that's impressive, but the speed at which it's been raised. If you take a look at CyborgMatt's Prize Pool Tracker, you can see the comparison to last year's fund-raiser. In 2013, the community raised $1,274,407 across the entirety of that Compendium's funding period. This year, they've made $4.4 million in just eleven days. If nothing else, it's a testament to how much the community has grown in the year since the game's official release.<br />\n<br />\nThe last few stretch goals guarantee Compendium owners new music, environmental effects and base customisation options. Additionally, a 1v1 mid-lane-only matchmaking option will be made available to all players.<br />\n<br />\nAs it stands   assuming the prize pool's distribution remains the same as last year   the winners of The International will make over $3 million. That's great news for whoever proves to be the top team, but, in his most recent Three Lane Highway, Chris argues that all this year's finalists should be getting a percentage of the pot.<br />\n<br />\n*You can apply this same answer to almost any question regarding Valve and money, which should make your end of year exam quite a bit easier.",

The episode wasn't quite as strong as episode two, for me, which found a near-perfect balance between interesting conversations, character progression and hard choices. But I loved reviewing episode three because it left me with so much to think about. It really made me question player agency in story-driven games and the difficulty of balancing the player's influence with the character's own personality. I think Clementine is a little too reliable in episode three compared to the adults around her, but Telltale really nailed making every decision a labor of fear and uncertainty.<br />\n<br />\nPhil Savage: Over the last few months, Gone Home's Steve Gaynor has been talking to a selection of game designers, and releasing their conversations as a podcast. It's called Tone Control, and it's now completed its first 'season'   with Gaynor taking a break as he works on The Fullbright Company's next project. That makes it a great time to dip into the archive, which is well worth doing if you're the sort of person who likes to spend hours listening to hot, intimate games chat. Which I am.<br />\n<br />\nNotable interviewees include Tim Schafer, Clint Hocking, Ken Levine, Craig Hubbard and more. Also, former PCG writer Tom Francis   who isn't a long-standing industry veteran, but did once buy me a whiskey, and so deserves a mention. Whoever Gaynor's talking to, he uncovers some fascinating insights into game design and creation.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTim Clark: The key art created to accompany the Far Cry 4 announcement is so   I dunno, let   s say startling   that, like Phil, I wasn   t even sure whether it was real or a particularly well-executed NeoGAF parody. Only a despotic junta leader of the most supreme self-confidence is able to rock that particular shade of purple.<br />\n<br />\nWhat isn   t in doubt is how glad I am to have a new Far Cry on the way. The heavily trailed Himalyan setting should provide plenty of opportunity to expand on the    savage beauty    vibe of the previous game, a shooter which has only grown in my admiration as more time has passed since I finished it. But here   s the key question: will there be a yeti hidden away in those foothills? And what is the monetary value of a yetiskin wallet? Asking for a friend.<br />\n<br />\nBen Griffin: There are three things I love in this world. The first is Dark Souls. The second is my reflection. And third is FIFA. But for the purposes of this bit, let   s just say third is The Sims (ordinarily it   s fifth, behind Christmas and the smell of cut grass). I   ve wasted my actual life playing the last three over the last 15 years, and yes before anyone points it out, I   m bitterly aware of the irony.<br />\n<br />\nThe trailer shows off the revamped character creator which does away with clunky menus, a range of body shapes from slim and ripped to morbidly obese and depressed, and a feature that lets you finetune wrinkles. Unlike last time around, it   s now possible to create someone without giving them a great honking moon face, and that   s what I   m most excited about. Now I can make my Sim as appealing as me. Also, it   s not always online like SimCity was, so you might even get to play it at launch!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTyler Wilde: I   m really happy to see player communities band together to keep old multiplayer games going, as they have with the Battlefield series. I could wag my finger at EA for not fighting to keep its old games running post-GameSpy shutdown, but that   s a dead end   our effort is better spent praising the players who are knocking down barriers to keep playing the games they love.<br />\n<br />\nChris Thursten: Dota events always feel like Christmas, but The International is something else. Super Christmas? Let's go with 'Super Christmas'. The Compendium   the in-game betting book that helps to crowdfund the tournament's prize pool   is the best expression of what Valve are trying to do with the game. It's been great to watch the community take ownership of Dota as an e-sport, whether that's finding more inventive ways to present the qualifier games or inflating the prize pool north of $5 million. As much as I'd like to see that prize pool distributed more evenly, that's a small gripe with an otherwise-great system.<br />\n<br />\nI've also enjoyed watching North American Rejects stampede through the American qualifiers. If you're one of the people on reddit who questioned my praise for the quality of play in that tournament this week, well, it was NAR I was referring to. The US has always struggled to pull together a team capable of living up to the hometown support they get at The International, and between EG and NAR this might just be the year where those chants of 'USA!' 'USA!' get heard outside of the lower bracket.<br />\n<br />\nRead on for our lows of the week   <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTHE LOWS<br />\n<br />\nTyler Wilde: I   m disappointed by NPCs across all of gaming, something I   ve been thinking about after reviewing Bound by Flame. I spend hours and hours with these characters   talking to them, fighting alongside them   and yet they   re so often just encyclopedias of information about my current quest, or the same greeting over and over. Even the most complex of them usually stare blankly at me when I stop talking, or can   t remember anything that wasn   t baked into their database of dialogue. They have no brains.<br />\n<br />\nI loved bonding with my crew in Mass Effect, and the way Telltale makes silence a choice. These are little steps, but NPCs still haven   t changed all that much in the past 10 years. More than improvements in graphics, I hope for more experimentation with how we interact with AI characters, especially where it leans toward simulation. I   m not ridiculously asking for true artificial intelligence, or guards who can beat the Turing test, just for characters who exhibit the illusion of intelligence well enough to surprise me now and then.<br />\n<br />\nTim Clark: The Division being delayed until 2015 is one of those things that, when it happens, seems so obvious that you have to take a mental inventory to check that it hasn   t actually happened already, but you forgot in all the unexcitement. Which isn   t to say I   m not excited by the game. I am muchly. I just never for a moment thought anything that looked so ambitious could be turned around in time for a release date this year.<br />\n<br />\nThe same goes for The Witcher 3. As soon as you got a sense of that project   s sprawling scope, you knew there were two hopes of it coming out on time. And the other was called Bob. There   s probably a direct inverse relationship between the level of polish demonstrated by vertical slice demos of new games, and the likelihood of any of the other content existing at the time they   re initially shown. Still, not that we should complain. Turns out there are quite a few other things to occupy ourselves with in the meantime   <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPhil Savage: Which version of Watch Dogs do you want. I've decided   just now, at random   that I'd like the basic game, the White Hat Pack, and the Conspiracy Mode Digital Trip DLC. Let me consult the big chart to see if... Well, shit.<br />\n<br />\nBuying AAA games is becoming an increasingly bizarre experience. I get why pre-orders matter to publishers, and why that leads to a series of exclusive deals made to retailers, but none of it seems to benefit the consumer. That's because, in my experience, these    exclusive    digital bonuses remain at best pointless, and at worst detrimental to the experience. In Watch Dogs, each outfit pack confers a bonus and, while that doesn't sound like a big thing, it has the potential to undermine the balance of the game. To make it worse, Watch Dogs has asymmetrical multiplayer. It may mean that, if I'm invading another player, I'm directly at a disadvantage for not having bought my copy through Game, or Uplay, or while riding a horse backwards through Tesco. Whatever you have to do to get the extra vehicle hitpoints of the    Club Justice Single-Player Pack   .<br />\n<br />\nWes Fenlon:  I'm torn on this one. Steam has added more games in the first half of 2014 than it did in the entirety of 2013. That's a ton of games, and I'm sure Early Access and Steam Greenlight are playing a big role there. Is it too many games? Not necessarily   I want everyone to have an opportunity to get a game on Steam   but it highlights how big an issue curation is going to become in the near future.<br />\n<br />\nValve is taking steps to make it easier to find games. Devs are able to put their games on sale whenever they want. User reviews now indicate that a game was reviewed in Early Access. But the Steam front page still mostly drives people to what's on sale and what's currently selling well. There are so many games, it's going to become increasingly hard for the average user to browse and discover something new. Games are going to get lost in the shuffle. More shovelware is going to slip through the cracks. Valve's going to have to do more curation to ensure Steam stays a useful storefront.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBen Griffin:    What is this I don   t even    probably best describes my reaction upon watching what little of Bombshell   s overlong, meaningless trailer I could stomach. It   s a game about a bomb defusal expert called Shelley    Bombshell    Harrison, so already the metaphors are a being complexly layered. Does she like bath bombs, too? How about photobombs? No? Just the explodey kind. Like Mass Effect   s Jack wearing a version of Ripley   s Power Loader as reimagined by Victoria   s Secret, Shelley enjoys \"kicking ass, motorcycles, and kicking ass on motorcycles.\" Kinda like how I enjoy playing games, sitting in my chair, and playing games while sitting in my chair.<br />\n<br />\nIf you   re smelling Eau de Nukem, your nose isn   t wrong. This was a 3D Realms joint (in collaboration with developers Interceptor Entertainment) called Duke Nukem: Mass Destruction until Gearbox acquired the Duke Nukem IP in 2010 and tried to sue the everloving stuffing from them. See how far into the trailer you can get, if you must. It   s a rubbish, dated top-down shooter with a rubbish, dated protagonist. Awesome name though. Bombshell. Strong.<br />\n<br />\nChris Thursten: This is one of those things that gets you widely derided in certain parts of the internet, but it   s been on my mind this week   and it might form the basis of a future Three Lane Highway column. In short: Twitch chat is one of the worst things about e-sports, and the only thing about the hobby that I find actively embarassing. This has been particularly apparent in the    Hub    streams being run for the TI4 qualifiers, Big Brother-style 24-hour shows where Dota personalities live and watch the games together while surrounded by kittens. It   s a cool idea, but it   s brought out a really ugly side of the community. The comments that get directed at women in particular make me embarrassed to associate myself with the scene.<br />\n<br />\nSomeone   s probably going to argue in the comments that this is just how things are on the internet, but I don   t see that as an excuse. It   s exclusionary, unprofessional, hurtful and lame and it   s holding back the game that these people purport to love. This might be as effective as yelling at a cloud, but seriously, guys: grow the fuck up.",

As teased all those months ago, his gently mocking wit is now available as a Dota 2 announcer pack. Sure, it's not hard to make fun of an incomprehensible game about internet wizards, but it takes skill to do it and still make the game's fans want to give you money.<br />\n<br />\nThe announcer pack was made by The Stanley Parable creator Davey Wreden and the Narrator's voice actor Kevan Brighting. According to Wreden   albeit jokingly   it aims to make Dota 2 \"not only understandable but even downright accessible to the common layperson\". Has it succeeded? If you'd rather not experience the pack in a live Dota environment, you can get a full preview at the Dota 2 wiki.<br />\n<br />\nIf you're so entrenched in Dota 2 that you don't know what The Stanley Parable is, you can find out via a 50% weekend sale. The Stanley Parable Announcer Pack is out now, and will be 10% off for 48 hours after release.",
